<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
This document is a collection of click scripts I have compiled over the years of performing a variety of offensive security engagements. I have broken everything up into seven main categories:
</div>

* [Pre-Engagement](/offensive/pre-engagement)
* [Reconnaissance](/offensive/recon)
* [Threat Modeling](/offensive/threat)
* [Vulnerability Identification](/offensive/vuln)
* [Exploitation](/offensive/exploitation)
* [Post-Exploitation](/offensive/post-exploit)
* [Reporting](/offensive/reporting)
