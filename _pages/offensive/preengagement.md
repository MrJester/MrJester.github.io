## Overview
This section will cover the basics of items and questions that should be reviewed and/or discussed during pre-engagement interviews. 

## Engagement Style
<ul>
    <li>Black Box</li>
    <li>Grey Box</li>
    <li>White Box</li>
</ul>

### Black Box
Black box engagements simulate an consultant that has been given zero internal knowledge of that target within scope. This does not include being provided with scope because this is a piece of information that should be included within the statement of work. 

### Grey Box
Grey box engagements simulate an consultant with some internal knowledge of the target. Such as network architecture diagrams, user credentials, or other information that would allow an upper hand.

### White box
White box engagements simulate a full cooperation engagement. During the engagement consultants and customers work hand in hand during testing to provide the most knowledge possible and allow complete testing.
